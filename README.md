# 50daysofCode

This repository contains **C++** code that I worked on during my summer break. Over the course of **50 days**, I explored various topics and concepts in C++ programming. Each code file focuses on a specific topic and serves as a learning resource for others interested in C++.

## Topics Covered

The repository covers a wide range of C++ topics, including but not limited to:

- Basics of C++(datatypes, variables)
- Control flow (`if-else` statements, loops)
- Functions and parameter passing
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Time Complexity analysis
- Precomputation techniques
- Hashing
- Recursion
- Sorting
- Number Theory
- Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms
- And more!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing a specific topic or concept. Within each folder, you will find individual code files related to that topic.

Feel free to explore the folders and files, and use them as a reference or learning material for your own C++ projects. I hope you find these code examples helpful in enhancing your understanding of C++ programming.
