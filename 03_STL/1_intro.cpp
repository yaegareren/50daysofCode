CONTAINERS:
>> Sequential:  // implemented sequentially like arrays
  >> vectors
  >> stack
  >> queue
  >> Pair(not a container)

>> Ordered:  // values stored in sorted order
  >> maps
  >> multimap
  >> set
  >> multiset

>> Unordered:   // based for hashing algorithms
  >> Unordered map
  >> Unordered set

>> Nested Containers (examples)
  >> vector <vector<int>>
  >> map <int,vector<int>>
  >> set <pair<int, string>>
  >> vector <map<int, set<int>>>

ITERATORS:
>> point to memory address of containers
>> begin(), end()
>> vector<int>:: iterator it;
>> continuity for containers

ALGORITHMS:
>> upper bound
>> lower bound
>> sort (comparator)
>> max_element
>> min_element
>> accumulate
>> reverse
>> count
>> find
>> next_permutations
>> prev_permutations

FUNCTORS: Classes which can act as functions
